## Overview
In today's data-driven financial landscape, accurately assessing customer creditworthiness is crucial. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict credit card scores by analyzing historical financial data, aiding financial institutions in making informed lending decisions and managing risk effectively.

## Project Description
The Credit Card Score Prediction project covers the entire machine learning workflow, from data preparation and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training and performance evaluation. The primary objectives of the project are to:
- **Enhance Predictive Accuracy:** Build models that accurately predict credit card scores based on key financial and demographic indicators.
- **Ensure Data Integrity:** Implement robust data cleaning and preprocessing routines to handle missing or inconsistent data.
- **Improve Model Robustness:** Evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective approach.
- **Support Scalability:** Develop a modular codebase that can be easily integrated into larger systems or adapted for deployment as a standalone service.
- **Increase Transparency:** Provide detailed visualizations and performance metrics that elucidate the model’s behavior and decision-making process.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Automated scripts to clean, normalize, and transform raw financial data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Jupyter Notebooks and visualizations that highlight trends, distributions, and correlations in the data.
- **Multiple Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Model Evaluation:** Detailed performance analysis using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
- **Modular Code Design:** Organized structure to facilitate easy updates, maintenance, and future enhancements.
- **Deployment Ready:** Scripts and modules designed for straightforward integration into production environments.

## Technologies Used

	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
	•	Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
	•	Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
	•	Interactive Analysis: Jupyter Notebook

## Data

The project utilizes historical financial data that includes:
	•	Customer Demographics: Age, employment status, and other personal attributes.
	•	Credit History: Records of past loans, repayment behavior, and credit activity.
	•	Financial Metrics: Income, expenditure, and spending patterns.

Raw data should be stored in the data/raw/ directory, while the preprocessing script transforms and cleans the data for modeling.

## Model Details

The project experiments with several machine learning models:
	•	Logistic Regression: Serves as a baseline to capture fundamental trends.
	•	Random Forest: Captures complex, non-linear relationships in the data.
	•	XGBoost: An advanced boosting algorithm that delivers robust performance with careful tuning.

Each model is evaluated using cross-validation and optimized through hyperparameter tuning to ensure reliable performance.

## Results and Evaluation

Model performance is assessed using multiple key metrics:
	•	Accuracy: The overall correctness of the model’s predictions.
	•	Precision & Recall: Metrics to evaluate the model’s performance in predicting positive cases.
	•	ROC-AUC: Measures the model’s ability to distinguish between classes.
