## Overview
In today's data-driven financial landscape, accurately assessing customer creditworthiness is crucial. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict credit card scores by analyzing historical financial data, aiding financial institutions in making informed lending decisions and managing risk effectively.

## Project Description
The Credit Card Score Prediction project covers the entire machine learning workflow, from data preparation and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training and performance evaluation. The primary objectives of the project are to:
- **Enhance Predictive Accuracy:** Build models that accurately predict credit card scores based on key financial and demographic indicators.
- **Ensure Data Integrity:** Implement robust data cleaning and preprocessing routines to handle missing or inconsistent data.
- **Improve Model Robustness:** Evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective approach.
- **Support Scalability:** Develop a modular codebase that can be easily integrated into larger systems or adapted for deployment as a standalone service.
- **Increase Transparency:** Provide detailed visualizations and performance metrics that elucidate the modelâ€™s behavior and decision-making process.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Automated scripts to clean, normalize, and transform raw financial data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Jupyter Notebooks and visualizations that highlight trends, distributions, and correlations in the data.
- **Multiple Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Model Evaluation:** Detailed performance analysis using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
- **Modular Code Design:** Organized structure to facilitate easy updates, maintenance, and future enhancements.
- **Deployment Ready:** Scripts and modules designed for straightforward integration into production environments.
